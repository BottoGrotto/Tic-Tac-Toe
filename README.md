This is a fun little project that I worked on while I was bored in class. 
The AP CSA class was making a tic tac toe game so I decided to make one because why not.
It's a game meant to be played by two players but I have only ever played it by myself.
It's not the most complicated game and hasn't been fully finished because I had to focus on other projects but hope if anyone plays to give me feedback on what I should improve/change.
